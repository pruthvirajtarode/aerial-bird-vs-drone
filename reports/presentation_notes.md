# Presentation (6 slides) - Notes & On-screen Cues

Slide 1 - Title
- Aerial Bird vs Drone
- Your name, role (B.Tech CSE), institute
- One-line objective: Classify aerial images to distinguish birds from drones for airspace safety.

Slide 2 - Dataset
- Explain dataset splits: train/valid/test counts
- Mention object_detection_Dataset for YOLOv8

Slide 3 - Model & Approach
- Transfer learning (EfficientNetB0)
- Augmentations, callbacks, Grad-CAM for explainability

Slide 4 - Demo
- Show Streamlit UI: upload -> predict -> Grad-CAM
- Live inference screenshot

Slide 5 - Results
- Confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1

Slide 6 - Next steps & Q/A
- Improve models, deploy, integrate detection
